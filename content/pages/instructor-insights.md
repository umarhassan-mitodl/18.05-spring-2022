## Student Information

### Enrollment

37 students

### Breakdown by Year

Mostly third- and fourth-year undergraduates

### Breakdown by Major

About 50% of the students were Electrical Engineering and Computer Science majors, most of whom were in either {{% resource_link "35181923-c822-43ca-be0a-66c6095683f5" "Computer Science and Molecular Biology" %}} or {{% resource_link "87079b04-b883-4ec9-a887-acddb7aee899" "Computation and Cognition" %}}; another 15% were Biology majors; the remainder represented a range of other fields.

## How Student Time Was Spent

During an average week, students were expected to spend 12 hours on the course, roughly divided as follows:

### Lectures (2 hours 40 minutes)

Met twice per week for 80 minutes per session; mandatory attendance.

### Studios (50 minutes)

Met once per week for 50 minutes per session, working on longer problems that involved the use of R, a computer programming language developed especially for statistical computing.

### Out of Class (8 hours 30 minutes)

Outside of class, students completed problem sets and studied for exams.
