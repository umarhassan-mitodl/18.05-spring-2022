### Requirements Satisfied

18.05 can be applied toward a [Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science](https://eecsis.mit.edu/degree_requirements.html), but is not required.

18.05 can be applied toward a [Minor in Economics](https://economics.mit.edu/academic-programs/undergraduate-program/minor-and-concentrations), but is not required.

18.05 satisfies the [Restricted Elective in Science and Technology (MIT General Institute Requirement)](https://catalog.mit.edu/mit/undergraduate-education/general-institute-requirements/#restrequirementtext).

Every spring semester

## Assessment

- Reading questions: 5% 
- In-class clicker questions: 5%
- Eleven problem sets, lowest grade dropped: 25% 
- Midterm exams (12.5% each) and R quiz (5%): 30%
- Final exam: 30%

## Student Information

### Enrollment

37 students

### Breakdown by Year

Mostly third- and fourth-year undergraduates

### Breakdown by Major

About 50% of the students were Electrical Engineering and Computer Science majors, most of whom were in either [Computer Science and Molecular Biology](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs/curriculum/6-7-computer-science-and-molecular-biology/) or [Computation and Cognition](https://bcs.mit.edu/academic-program/course-6-9-computation-and-cognition); another 15% were Biology majors; the remainder represented a range of other fields.

## How Student Time Was Spent

During an average week, students were expected to spend 12 hours on the course, roughly divided as follows:

### Lectures (2 hours 40 minutes)

Met twice per week for 80 minutes per session; mandatory attendance.

### Studios (50 minutes)

Met once per week for 50 minutes per session, working on longer problems that involved the use of R, a computer programming language developed especially for statistical computing.

### Out of Class (8 hours 30 minutes)

Outside of class, students completed problem sets and studied for exams.
