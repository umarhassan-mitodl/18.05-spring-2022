In order to run simulations of experiments with random outcomes we make use of R's ability to generate random numbers. More precisely it generates a 'pseudo-random' number, which behaves in many ways like a truly random number.

## The Function Sample(x, k, replace = TRUE)

```plaintext
# sample(x,k) generates a random permutation of k objects from the vector x. 
That is, all k choices are different.
# start with a vector x with 5 elements. 
> x = 1:5 
> print(x) 
[1] 1 2 3 4 5
# randomly sample 3 of the elements of x. 
> y = sample(x, 3) 
> print(y) 
[1] 2 5 1 # Your answer may be different. 
> y = sample(x, 3) 
> print(y) 
[1] 3 1 4 # Your answer may be different. 
> sample(x, 3) 
> print(y) 
[1] 1 2 5 # Your answer may be different. 
# Note every element is chosen at most once.
# randomly sampling 5 elements of x is a permutation of all 5 elements. 
> y = sample(x, 5) 
> print(y) 
[1] 1 3 2 5 4 # Your answer may be different. 
> y = sample(x, 5) 
> print(y) 
[1] 2 3 1 4 5 # Your answer may be different.
# You can't pick more than 5 different elements from a set of 5 things, so R gives an error.
> sample(x, 6) 
Error in sample.int(length(x), size, replace, prob): 
  cannot take a sample larger than the population when 'replace = FALSE'
```

**Allowing repeated elements**         
\# Sometimes you want to allow repeats. For example when  we roll a die repeatedly we expect to see numbers repeating. We can think of this as picking a random element from a set and then putting it back, i.e. replacing it, so it can be drawn again.

\# In R we do this by setting the optional argument replace=TRUE

```plaintext
# Note that we get can get repeated values 
> y = sample(x, 3, replace=TRUE) 
> print(y) 
[1] 3 1 4 # Your answer may be different. 
> y = sample(x, 3, replace=TRUE) 
> print(y) 
[1] 4 5 4 # Your answer may be different. 
> y = sample(x, 3, replace=TRUE) 
> print(y) 
[1] 2 1 5 # Your answer may be different. 
> y = sample(x, 5, replace=TRUE) 
> print(y) 
[1] 5 1 5 1 4 # Your answer may be different. 
> y = sample(x, 5, replace=TRUE) 
> print(y) 
[1] 3 5 5 2 1 # Your answer may be different. 
> y = sample(x, 5, replace=TRUE) 
> print(y) 
[1] 4 2 3 2 1 # Your answer may be different.
```

\# Now there is no problem asking for more than 5 things from a set of 5 elements.  

```plaintext
> y = sample(x, 12, replace=TRUE) 
> print(y) 
[1] 1 1 2 1 4 2 3 4 1 2 4 5 # Your answer may be different. 
> y = sample(x, 12, replace=TRUE) 
> print(y) 
[1] 3 2 5 1 4 2 4 1 4 5 3 1 # Your answer may be different.
```

\# To generate an m x n array of random values we can use the function sample function followed by the matrix function.

\# Let's simulate rolling a die.           
\# We use 1:6 to make vector (1,2,3,4,5,6).

```plaintext
# Generate a 3 x 4 array of random dice rolls. 
> y = sample(1:6, 12, replace=TRUE) 
> z = matrix(y, nrow=3, ncol=4) 
> print(z) 
    [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] 
[1,]    1    3    6    1 
[2,]    2    2    3    6 
[3,]    2    1    4    3
# Or we could make it a 2 x 6 array. 
> z = matrix(y, nrow=2, ncol=6) 
> print(z) 
    [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] 
[1,]    1    2    2    6    4    6 
[2,]    2    3    1    3    1    3 
# Your answer may be different. 
```

## Simulation  

\# First let's simulate rolling 1 die 3 times and checking if one of the rolls was a 6.

\# First we use sample to generate 3 samples from 1:6  

```plaintext
> x = sample(1:6, 3, replace=TRUE) 
> print(x) 
[1] 6 4 1  # Your answer may be different.
```

\# To check if any of the 3 rolls are 6 we use the following command. It returns a vector of TRUE or FALSE depending on whether that entry of x is 6 or not. Note the use of the double equal sign. We can't use a single equal sign because that would mean 'set the value of x to 6'. Compare the result with the value of x above.  

```plaintext
> print(x == 6) 
[1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE 
# Your answer may be different.
```

\#  We can also see which elements of x are less than 6  

```plaintext
> print(x < 6) 
[1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE 
# Your answer may be different.
```

\#  Now let's roll the die 1000 times and see what fraction of the rolls give 6. We expect that about 1/6 of them will be.

\# Simulate 1000 rolls  

```plaintext
> x = sample(1:6, 1000, replace=TRUE) 
# Your answer may be different.
```

\# x == 6 gives a vector of TRUE or FALSE. R is clever, when we sum the vector: each TRUE counts as 1 and each FALSE counts as 0. So the sum is the number of TRUE's. In this case that means the number of 6's, which happens to be 168.   

```plaintext
> s = sum(x == 6) 
> print(s) 
[1] 168   
# Your answer may be different.
```

\# Divide by 1000 to get the fraction of 6's.  

```plaintext
> a = sum(x == 6)/1000 
> print(a) 
[1] 0.168   
# Your answer may be different.
```

\# Compare that with the theoretical value of 1/6.  

```plaintext
> print(1/6) 
[1] 0.1666667 
# Not bad!
```

\# Now let's estimate the probability of getting at least one 6 in 4 rolls.

\# Goal: estimate the probability of getting at least one 6 in 4 rolls.          
\# Experiment: roll 1 die 4 times and check for a 6.           
\# Repeat the experiment 10 times and see what fraction of times this happens.

\# So you can see all the commands at once, we'll show them all and then explain them later. For commenting, we'll put a command number before each '>'   

```plaintext
1. > x = matrix(sample(1:6, 4*10, replace=TRUE), nrow=4, ncol=10) 

2. > print(x) 
    [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10] 
[1,]    5    6    1    1    3    6    1    4    6     1 
[2,]    3    6    6    4    3    2    2    1    6     5 
[3,]    2    3    5    2    5    3    4    6    2     5 
[4,]    2    6    6    5    5    3    1    4    5     3 
# Your answer may be different.

3. > y = (x==6) 

4. > print(y) 
     [,1]  [,2]  [,3]  [,4]  [,5]  [,6]  [,7]  [,8]  [,9] [,10] 
[1,] FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE 
[2,] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE 
[3,] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE 
[4,] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE 
# Your answer may be different.

5. > z = colSums(y) 

6. > print(z) 
[1] 0 3 2 0 0 1 0 1 2 0 
# Your answer may be different.

7. > print(z > 0) 
[1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE 

8. > s = sum(z > 0) 

9. > print(s) 
[1] 5   # Your answer may be different.

10. > m = mean(z > 0) 

11. > print(m) 
[1] 0.5 # Your answer may be different.
```

\# Command 1: Generate a 4 by 10 random array. Each column represents one experimental trial of 4 rolls. The 10 columns represent the 10 trials.       
\# Command 2: Display x       
\# Command 3: See which of the rolls are 6's. Note the double equals to check which rolls were 6. The result y is an array of TRUE or FALSE. You can check that it picks out the 6's.       
\# Command 4: Display y       
\# Command 5: Sum each of the columns. The result is then number of 6's in each trial (column).       
\# Command 6: Display z       
\# Command 7: If the column sum is greater than 0 there was at least one TRUE in the column, that is at least one 6. This command prints a vector of TRUE or FALSE representing  whether or not the experiment yielded a 6.       
\# command 8: sum the vector in command 7 to get the number of trials that yielded a 6. We see that 5 out of 10 trials did. (This is random. Your answer may be different.)       
\# Command 9: Display s       
\# command 10: The mean function is just the sum divided by the number of trials. This is just 5/10 = .5. Half the trials yielded a 10.       
\# command 11: Disply the mean

\# Let's repeat this but with 1000 trials instead of 10. Without all the comments it's pretty short.  

```plaintext
> x = matrix(sample(1:6, 4*1000, replace=TRUE), nrow=4, ncol=1000) 
> y = (x==6) 
> z = colSums(y) 
> print(sum(z > 0)) 
[1] 525 
> print(mean(z>0)) 
[1] 0.525
```

Our estimate of the probability of at least one 6 in 4 rolls is .525. This is pretty close to the theoretical value of .518.

**The dim() function**          
\# We can always check that x has 4 rows and 1000 columns using the dim() function.  

```plaintext
> print(dim(x)) 
[1]    4 1000
```

## One More Simulation  

\# Goal: estimate the probability of getting a sum of 7 when rolling two dice.  

```plaintext
1. > ntrials = 10000 
2. > x = matrix(sample(1:6, 2*ntrials, replace=TRUE), nrow=2, ncol=ntrials) 
3. > y = colSums(x) 
4. > print(mean(y == 7)) 
[1] 0.1658
```

\# Command 1: We assign the number of trials to the variable ntrials. Writing code like this makes it easier to modify later. If we want to change the number of trials to 7 we just have to change this one line of code.          
\# Command 2: we create 10000 columns with 2 rows. That is, we run 10000 experiments of rolling 2 dice.          
\# Command 3: we sum each of the columns, i.e., we sum the two dice.          
\# Command 4: we find the fraction of sums that are 7.

\# Note, this is essentially the exact answer of 1/6.

Exercise: Try to estimate the probability of two sixes when rolling two dice.
