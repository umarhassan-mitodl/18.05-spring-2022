  \ able to work on the assigned problems in the PDF files, then use an interactive\
  \ problem set checker to input each answer into a box and find out if the answer\
  \ was correct or incorrect. Students could use the problem set checker as many times\
  \ as they wanted to, and they weren\u2019t graded on this in any way."
